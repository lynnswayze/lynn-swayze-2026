      <h1>Now</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my /Now page. What is a now page, you  may ask? A now page is a more up-to-date about page, meant to convey
        what I am doing <em>right now</em>, such as what I'm reading, what I'm working on, and what I'm studying. For many people, this Page
        serves as a sort of "static social media" which one could check in on and find that it's changed.</p>
        
        <h2>December 2025</h2>
      <p>Of course, it's the end of the year and right now, I'm racing until January 2026. I had a <em>great</em> Christmas with my family, and built this site 
      during my downtime from my marketing contracts.</p>
