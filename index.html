      <h1>My Background</h1>
       <p>When I was a child, I would stuff a bath towel under my door and spend my nights reading <em>Illustrated Classics</em>, Redwall books, and other fiction. By 5th grade, it was decided:<br>
         <em>"I will be a writer for a living."</em><br>
         But making a living as a writer isn't easy without education, experience, and skill, so I did the next best thing for someone inclined toward writing and computers did in 2004: I became a marketer. 
         My first job in 2004 was to load data into spreadsheets and early CRMs in an Information Marketing company called
       <em>The College Network</em>, then later as a Helpdesk Consultant and Technical Writer, then as a Direct Response Copywriter once I learned how to blog and write long-form copy from
       places like American Writers and Artists (AWAI), Copy Chief with Kevin Rogers <em>(closed as of 2025!)</em>, Dan Kennedy's "Magnetic Marketing," and more. </p>
