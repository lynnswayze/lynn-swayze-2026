      <h2>Introduction</h2>
   When it comes to living the life of an Intuitive Marketer (or, more broadly, an Intuitive Person), you learn very quickly that the little moments others take for granted—waking up, preparing to start creative work, or going to bed—truly set the tone to how productive, how profitable, and how enjoyable your moments and work are. The Intuitive Marketer's life is an intentional and attentional one, and cultivating deliberate, daily habits is how you focus your intention, attention, and intuition toward your goals.
Émile Coué was a pharmacist and psychologist who, at least in my mind, was an early thinker within New Thought. He created the idea of the affirmative mantra ("Conscious Autosuggestion"), to be said in what we now know of as the hypnogogic state before bed. He advised saying each day before bed, "Every day, in every way, I'm getting better and better."
A quote I found from Wikipedia. I do suggest looking him up; Mitch Horowitz has a great reprint of Coué (affiliate-free link):
We possess within us a force of incalculable power, which, when we handle it unconsciously is often prejudicial to us. If on the contrary we direct it in a conscious and wise manner, it gives us the mastery of ourselves and allows us not only to escape … from physical and mental ills, but also to live in relative happiness, whatever the conditions in which we may find ourselves.
—Coué, 1922b, p.35.[8]

<h2>>My Daily Patterns</h2>
Here's how that looks in daily life, from a high level. You'll need at least two notebooks for this, plus some kind of timer like a kitchen timer or, as a last choice, your phone's timer.

<h3>Upon Waking Up:</h3>
Unless some other necessity demands it, I encourage you to keep a physical notebook and a pen by your bed. This is so that when you wake up, you will immediate go to your notebook and record your dreams. It doesn't matter how weird, silly, quick, or long your dream is, just write it down. You may remember nothing at first, but keep at it because this remembering and noting tells your Subconscious (aka Your Wonderful Human Imagination aka your Intuition aka Your Higher Self) that dreams are important to you, and thus can become a source of information and insight.

<h3>After Waking:</h3>
    <p>I generally spend a few minutes each morning to wash my hands, feed the cats, pee, and grab a cup of coffee. Then I will sit down with a list generated in a second notebook containing:
<ul>
<li>My Daily Chief Aim</li>
<li>My list of mantras</li>
<li>My running "20 things" list</li>
<li>My intention for the day and one outcome I am feeling into</li>
</ul>
I will then run through each of these as I sit quietly on my couch and drink coffee, often writing my list again each day to cement them with kinesthetic writing. I will also work on "grounding" my energy, running fresh energy through my energy meridians and out my head, and expanding my heart energy.
I'll talk about these another day.
</p>
<h3>Before a Working Session:</h3>
<p>Before work, I always set an intention for the endeavor. I spend a few moments energetically connecting with the audience, with how I want them to feel, with the outcome I want to achieve from the work, and sometimes the Expert I'm writing for if I'm writing for someone else. (I may channel that Expert so that I can hear their voice in my head, which helps with writing "on brand" copy.)
</p>
<h3>After a Working Session:</h3>
<p>This is a new practice, but due to my energetic sensitivity I now spend time "disconnecting" from my clients so that I do not carry their energy, goals, thoughts, emotions, stress, etc with me by imagining disconnecting, by washing my hands, and by reconnecting to myself and the core in the center of my being. Otherwise, I will find myself wanting things which aren't "me" and engaging in career paths which are unsuited for me. To each their own, but I highly recommend some kind of action or ritual to disconnect after each working session, especially if you write copy, do marketing, or coach others.</p>

<h3>Before Eating:</h3>  
<p>This is super woo and so your mileage may vary, but I've found it very helpful in feeling more enjoyment in eating and in bringing deliberate intention and attention to every part of my life. Before eating, I will spend a brief moment blessing the food/drink I will eat and connecting energetically to the consciousness and energy of the food. I try to eat as much fresh food as possible, ideally fruits and vegetables, so that they still contain life force. I then thank the food for its nourishment, and thank whoever prepared the food (often my husband!) and feel gratefulness for having food at all. This is pretty similar to a bracha and what the kabbalists do, if you want to dig further.</p>
<h3>Before Bed/Sleep:</h3>
<p>Before bed, I aim, where possible, to run through my entire list again, which to repeat is as follows except this time, I will write down what I accomplished in the day as well as my intention for what I'd like to dream about (includes copy!):
<ul>
<li>My Daily Chief Aim</li>
<li>My list of mantras</li>
<li>My running "20 things" list</li>
<li>What I accomplished in the day, thankfulness</li>
<li>My intention for the night</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If I am particularly wanting to manifest something specific, I will spend my last waking moments specifically envisioning and acting out, in my mind, that scene I want to happen.
</p>
If you try them, let me know how they go!
